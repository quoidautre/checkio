You are given a positive integer. Your function should calculate the product of the digits excluding any zeroes.

For example: The number given is 123405. The result will be 1*2*3*4*5=120 (don't forget to exclude zeroes).

Hints: This task can be solved with a simple conversion from int to str and versus. Read more about built-in types here.

Input: A positive integer.

Output: The product of the digits as an integer.

Example:

checkio(123405) == 120
checkio(999) == 729
checkio(1000) == 1
checkio(1111) == 1
How it is used: This task can teach you how to solve a problem with simple data type conversion.
