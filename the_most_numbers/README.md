Let's work with numbers.

You are given an array of numbers (floats). You should find the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. Your function should receive the variable number of arguments. For an empty argument list, the function should return 0.

Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions (read about this here). So we should check the result with Â±0.001 precision.

Hints: Think about how to work with the variable number of arguments.

Input: The variable number of arguments, numbers.

Output: The difference between maximum and minimum.

Example:

checkio(1, 2, 3) == 2
checkio(5, -5) == 10
checkio(10.2, -2.2, 0, 1.1, 0.5) == 12.4
checkio() == 0
How it is used: Here you will learn about using the variable number of arguments for functions.
