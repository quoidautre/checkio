Let's teach the Robots to distinguish words and numbers.

You are given a string with words and numbers separated by whitespaces (one space). The words contains only letters. You should check is the string contains three words in succession.

Hints: You can easily solve this task with these useful functions: str.split, str.isalpha and str.isdigit.

Precondition: The input contains words and/or numbers. Mixed words (letters and digits combined) are not allowed.

Input: A string with words.

Output: True or False, a boolean.

Example:
checkio("Hello World hello") == True
checkio("He is 123 man") == False
checkio("1 2 3 4") == False
checkio("bla bla bla bla") == True
checkio("Hi") == False
How it is used: This teaches you how to work with strings and introduces some useful functions.

Each player can create their own missions on CheckiO starting at level 9. You have the ability to create challenges for your friends and maybe even get your mission published on CheckiO for the whole community!
