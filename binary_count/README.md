For the Robots the decimal format is inconvenient. If they need to count to "1", their computer brains want to count it in the binary representation of that number. You can read more about binary here.

You are given a number (a positive integer). You should convert it to the binary format and count how many unities (1) are in it.

Hints: This task can be easily solved with two functions -- bin and count.

Input: A number as a positive integer.

Output: The quantity of unities in the binary form, an integer.

Example:

checkio(4) == 1
checkio(15) == 4
checkio(1) == 1
checkio(1022) == 9
How it is used: How to convert a number to the binary form. It can be useful for Computer Science purposes.
