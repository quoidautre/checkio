For language training our Robots want to learn about suffixes.

In this task, you are given a set of words in lower case. 'Check' is one word that sometimes appears at the end of the another word.

Hints: For this task you should know how to iterate through set types and string data type functions. Read more about set type here and string functions here.

Input: A set of words.

Output: True or False, as a boolean.

Example:

checkio({"hello", "lo", "he"}) == True
checkio({"hello", "la", "hellow", "cow"}) == False
checkio({"walk", "duckwalk"}) == True
checkio({"one"}) == False
How it is used: Here you can learn about iterating through set type and string data type functions.
