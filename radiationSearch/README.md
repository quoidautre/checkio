The robots got to know that the last container NxN (3<=N<=10) that came from another island has radiation. There are five different kinds of spare parts. It is known that the radiation comes from the biggest union of the parts. Help them find the biggest group of spare parts that stay near each other and point out their quantity and the number itself.

We have a matrix A NxN (3<=N<=10). Numbers between 1 and 5 are the elements of A. Find the biggest group of equal numbers that stay near each other and point out their quantity and the number itself.
