Help Stephen to break down the weight in such a way so that when he takes all the details in his both hands the difference between the weights in each hand is minimal. Nikolaâ€™s details cannot be broken into parts which means the weight of one detail cannot be divided between the hands.

__Input data:__ Input contains list of weights of the details.

__Output data:__ a number representing the minimal possible weight difference between details in his each hands.

__Example:__

checkio([10,10]) == 0
checkio([10]) == 10
checkio([5, 8, 13, 27, 14]) == 3
checkio([5,5,6,5]) == 1
checkio([12, 30, 30, 32, 42, 49]) == 9
checkio([1, 1, 1, 3]) == 0
